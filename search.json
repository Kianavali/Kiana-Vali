    "text": "The brain, once thought to be immunologically privileged, is now recognized as a dynamic immune environment with a diverse array of resident and infiltrating immune cells. Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, are central to maintaining homeostasis, while border-associated immune populations—including perivascular macrophages, meningeal dendritic cells, and infiltrating T cells—play critical roles in surveillance and neuroimmune interactions. ## Dataset and Analysis Overview For my final project, I analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data generated by our lab from young and aged mouse brains. The dataset includes ~20,000 cells per age group, derived from whole-brain single-cell suspensions sorted for live cells and sequenced using the 10x Genomics platform. This analysis focuses on endothelial cells, macrophages , and T cells— some of the key populations at the brain’s immune–vascular interface. By comparing age-related changes in the expression of adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM1, VCAM1) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., CXCL10), the project aims to uncover how aging alters immune signaling and vascular function.\n#read data file\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nDEG_data &lt;- read_excel(\"DEG_All_Condition_All_CellType 1.xlsx\", sheet = 1)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n#head\n\n# Define the cell types you want to keep\ncell_types &lt;- c(\"Endothelial_cells\", \"Macrophages\", \"T_memory_cells\")\n\n# Filter the DEG dataset to keep only these 2 cell types\nfiltered_deg &lt;- DEG_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Cluster %in% cell_types)\n\n# Check how many gene comparisons exist for each selected cell type\ntable(filtered_deg$Cluster)\n\n\nEndothelial_cells       Macrophages    T_memory_cells \n            64413             16803              6767\nyoung_vs_aged &lt;- filtered_deg %&gt;%\n  filter(ident.1 == \"G2_old\", ident.2 == \"G1_young\")\ntable(young_vs_aged$Cluster)\n\n\nEndothelial_cells       Macrophages    T_memory_cells \n            10813               477               524\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Step 1: Broader inflammation/immune gene panel\ninflammatory_genes &lt;- c(\n  \"Il1b\", \"Il6\", \"Tnf\", \"Ifng\", \n  \"Ccl2\", \"Ccl3\", \"Ccl4\", \"Cxcl9\", \"Cxcl10\",\n  \"Cd74\", \"Cd80\", \"Cd86\", \"Cd274\", \"Pdcd1lg2\",\n  \"H2-Ab1\", \"H2-Aa\", \"H2-Eb1\", \"Tap1\", \"Tapbp\",\n  \"Icam1\", \"Vcam1\", \"Sele\", \"Sell\", \n  \"Lyz2\", \"Nos2\", \"Ptprc\"\n)\n\n# Step 2: Filter for the genes and relevant cell types\ncell_types_focus &lt;- c(\"Endothelial_cells\", \"Macrophages\", \"T_memory_cells\")\n\ninflamm_subset &lt;- DEG_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Cluster %in% cell_types_focus,\n         gene_symbol %in% inflammatory_genes,\n         ident.1 == \"G2_old\", ident.2 == \"G1_young\")  # ensure aged vs young only\n\n# Step 3: Plot as ggplot heatmap\nggplot(inflamm_subset, aes(x = Cluster, y = gene_symbol, fill = avg_log2FC)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", mid = \"white\", high = \"red\", midpoint = 0,\n                       name = \"log2FC\") +\n  labs(title = \"Log2 Fold Change of Broad Inflammatory Genes (Aged vs. Young)\",\n       x = \"Cell Type\", y = \"Gene\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        panel.grid = element_blank())"
